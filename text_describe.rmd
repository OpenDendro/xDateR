Standard descriptive statistics and a plot are produced. Users can filter (remove) series from the data set in the next tab. A report can be generated at the bottom of the page. This uses the dplR functions [`rwl.report`](https://rdrr.io/cran/dplR/man/rwl.report.html), [`summary.rwl`](https://rdrr.io/cran/dplR/man/rwl.stats.html), and [`plot.rwl`](https://rdrr.io/cran/dplR/man/plot.rwl.html). Proceed to the next tab to look at the correlations between series.
